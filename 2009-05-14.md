## QUICK TALK! #23, STÉPHANE BACHMANN

May 07, 2009 @ 12:42 PM - [Paulo’s Portugese](http://digbmx.com/blog/paulo_martins/)

I remember the first time I’ve saw Stéphane, it was in 1995 in Geneve, Switzerland, at a demo with Taj and Steve Swope, with Mat Hoffman as a MC. Eleven years latter in 2006 I was with 14 friends at a Euro BMX trip and we stopped in Geneve, to search and ride some good trails, that a few guys had ridden in the previous year trip. After a few minutes at the local skatepark (Plainpalais) we spotted 2 local riders, “Gordo” and Adrien, after a few attemps to talk in French with the two, asking about directions to the trails, I realized that “Gordo” had a familiar accent in his french...that sounds portuguese, I asked him if he speak portuguese and he said “Sim, sou brasileiro (yes, I’m from Brazil)”. That’s Enough… we started to speak in portuguese and he tell us that Adrien have some “secret” trails that we are invited to ride. A few minutes after we get at the trails Stéphane made his appearance for a ride at his local trails and found 15 unknow to him, portuguese riders, riding the trails, we started talking and found that we allready met 11 years ago… It was his father who organized the Demo with, Taj, Mat, and Steve in 1995.

In 2007 he made a visit to Portugal with his girl friend, and brought his bike, and we show to they a lot of good places to ride, eat and drink. Stéphane became a fan of Portugal and of “Caldo-Verde”. We consider him as a friend.
