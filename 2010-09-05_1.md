# LHC clips from Ian Moult

<!-- Manuel Hitz -->

The video shows Ian riding in Geneva (Switzerland!), then I guess Uni Düsseldorf (Germany) and Barcelona (Spain), and finally back in Geneva. I saw him riding once at the Geneva skatepark, but he doesn’t seem to want to get involved much in the local scene. Anyways, some solid self-filmed street riding:
