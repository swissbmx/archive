# L’ouverture de la cabane?

<!-- Mohamed Ishuayed -->

Now that the sun is shining once more on our small city of Geneva, I am happy to annonce to everyone that the workshop at the Plainpalais skatepark has finally reopened. Every Wednesday, Saturday and Sunday from 2 o’clock to 6 o’clock, or from 3 to 7 (depending on the day) you will find our workshop open with an expert on site to help you out with any problems you may have with your BMX, skate or rollerblades (the man on site might even help you with your scooter and mountain bike if he’s nice enough). So stop by and make the guys earn the money they’re making!
